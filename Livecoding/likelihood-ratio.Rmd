1. An instructor believes that the number of students who arrive late to class should follow a Poisson distribution. The table below indicates the number of such students in 10 consecutive classes.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}\hline
number of late students & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
frequency & 3& 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{10}$ denote the number of students who were late to each of the 10 classes. A reasonable model is 
$$X_{1}, X_2, \dots, X_{10} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} Pois(\lambda).$$


In this exercise, you will first derive the likelihood ratio test for testing
$$H_0: \theta = 1, \ \ H_1: \theta \neq 1$$


a. Calculate the p-value using the chi-square distribution. Be sure to check if the quadratic approximation seems reasonable for the log likelihood function. 

b. Calculate the empirical p-value. Set a random number seed of 42535.
